/**
 *  Do the programming here. I setup the html for you and basic styles.
 *
 *  It is sort of complicated but can be broken down into steps.
 *
 *    - There are two players and the turns alternate each time.
 *        You can keep track of this by storing it in a variable `currentPlayer`. 0 will mean player 1. and 1 will mean player 2
 *
 *    - Add event listeners to each grid item and on click:
 *      - Check if the square that was clicked is available (hasnt been clicked yet)
 *        - if it isnt then do nothing
 *      - Check which current player's turn it is and add text to the item based on the current player (player 1 is "0" player 2 is "x")
 *
 *    - Check if there are anywinners (you will need to write an algorithm that checks for 3 of the same pieces in a row â€” checking diagonal will be the hardest part)
 *
 *    - If there was a winner then do something like "alert('Player 1 won')" or something to notify the user
 *
 *    - If no one has won yet then switch the current user to the other player and repeat until there is a winner
 *
 *
 * HINTS:
 *   - You will need to use document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll to query for the elements. This is how you interact with them.
 *
 *   - You will need to use addEventListener on the elements you queried for to watch for click events on the items.
 *
 *   -
